# To Do
---
- [ ] **Create a function to pause the alarm of the apple**

    Implement it as well in the `togglePause` function;
    currently, when the pause button is pressed, the
    apple continues to disappear

- [ ] **Make the apple not to go out of the board**

    I think it is because there are too many elements inside the board;
    I might make the board to remove the different blocks that it doesn't
    use, or something like that

- [ ] **Make the menu actually work**
- [ ] **Implement animation in the movement of the blocks**

    Positioning the snake blocks absolutely and then translate them
    with css is the approach I am thinking of. Also, implement
    a little animation that makes the blocks of the snake (including head)
    to shake from one side to the other

- [ ] **Make the start button actually work**

    It's been pissing me off the whole development; fix it ASAP
